## Effective Bandwidth for Delay Tolerant Secondary User Traffic in Multi-PU, Multi-SU Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks
#### Ebrahim Safavi and K.P. Subbalakshmi

In this paper, we study two important quality of service (QoS) parameters of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks with multiple primary and secondary users. We assume that the secondary users (SUs) are delay tolerant and model the primary user (PU) and SU activity as Markov chains with ON and OFF states. We derive a closed form expression for the probability distribution of buffer occupancy for secondary networks under steady state conditions and formulate an expression for the effective bandwidth under buffer overflow constraints. Extensive simulations are used to validate our analysis.
